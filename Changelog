Revision history for Perl extension CDB_File.

1.06
- Change course w/ utf8 mode: instead, provide a string_mode that allows
  strings to be considered either Latin-1 strings or character strings.
  This breaks compatibility with anything that adopted the utf8 flag added
  in 1.04, but since that was so recent this seems an acceptable risk.

1.05 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-12-11
- Additional tests for known corner cases.
- Use Perl_warn not warn in XS.
- Test cleanup. Abstract helper calls.
- Macro cleanup in XS for code readability.

1.04 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-12-10
- add utf8 mode for read/write of database
- Major re-factor to remove SVs from the CDB internals. SVs are only generated at return.
  This was in attempt to address a known memory leak in the previous implementation.
- CDB_File will warn if undef keys or values are passed to insert. This is meant to be
  consistent with how Perl handles the situation.
- Consistently tidy CDB_File.xs and remove tabs
- Make unit tests use File::Temp so we don't leave temp files laying around
- update Devel::PPPort to 3.62

1.03 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-11-13
WARNING: due to a bug (#12) on 1.02, CDB databases generated by 1.02 will
not be legible by all other versions and vice-versa. It is recommended you
re-generate any databases generated by that version.

- #12 Fix incompatibility with CDB files due to accidental algorithm change.
  Add xt tests for 0.96 databases to assure this does not happen again.
- Fixup Changelog for metacpan
- #11 Add additional benchmark test in git for.
- Provide the CDB_File algorithm in POD in the event the original document is lost.
- Update Devel::PPPort to 3.54

1.02 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-01-29
- Invoke new as a class method in docs and practice.
- Add support for COW PVs when returning key values. This will hopefully
  deduplicate returned strings where possible.
- Adjust tests to skip exists tests on 5.8.1, not 5.6.2
- Optimize cdb_hashadd as a inline macro
- Croak if atomic re-write from the temp to the final file fails.

1.01 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-01-27
- Fix MANIFEST so Changelog is shpped.
- Address file descriptor leak in CDB_File.

1.00 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2020-01-19
- Enable github actions for automated testing
- Switch to github issues.

0.99 - J. Nick Koston <bdraco@cpan.org> 2016-07-16
- Add a fetch_all function for 1:1 hash mapping

0.98 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2015-06-30
- Replace use vars with our (deprecated since 5.6.0)
- Switch from Dynaloader to XSLoader as it's known to be a lower memory profile module.

0.97_01 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-05
- Put ppport.h back in with an updated version.
- ppport.h warnings now indicate that the module is not perl 5.6 compatible,
  but the test suite continues to succeed there. p5p suggests dropping support
  for 5.6

0.97 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-05
- CPAN testers looks relativley clean. Publishing a stable version.

0.96_02 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-03
- Perl 5.6 doesn't warn about $x{undef}. Skip this test for 5.6

0.96_01 - Todd Rinaldo <toddr@cpan.org> 2011-04-01
- Remove ppport.h from distro on reccommendation from ppport.h
- Remove C99 style code from CDB_File to allow GCC 2.95 compilers to work
- Modernize Makefile.PL and require Test::More
- Update tests to use Test::More
- Fix makefile - {'d_mmap'}  isn't always defined
- Cleanup temp files during testing
- Untie before file removal so windows doesn't block the removal

  when building CDBs.

0.94
- Made work on perl 5.8.1
- Added some notes about performance

0.93
- Switched to allocating memory on the heap. I have no idea how the
  previous scheme worked at all. It should have fallen over everywhere.

  about calling NEXT before calling FIRST.
